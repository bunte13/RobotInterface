\section{WebSockets and Real-time Communication}
The application uses SignalR to enable real-time communication between the client and server:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{SignalR Hub}: The \texttt{RobotHub} class manages real-time communication.
	\item \textbf{Client-Side Interaction}: JavaScript on the client-side connects to the SignalR hub to send commands and receive responses in real-time.
\end{itemize}
