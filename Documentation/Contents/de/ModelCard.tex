\chapter{Model Card}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Model Details -  Basic information about the model
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Person or organization developing model
      \item Model date
      \item Model version
      \item Model type
      \item Information about training algorithms, parameters, fairness constraints or other applied approaches, and features
      \item Paper or other resource for more information
      \item Citation details
      \item License
      \item Where to send questions or comments about the model
    \end{itemize}
  \item Intended Use. Use cases that were envisioned during development.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Primary intended uses
      \item Out-of-scope use cases
    \end{itemize}
  \item Factors: Factors could include demographic or phenotypic groups, environmental conditions, technical attributes, or others
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Relevant factors
      \item Evaluation factors
    \end{itemize}
  \item Metrics: Metrics should be chosen to reflect potential real world impacts of the model.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item   Model performance measures
      \item   Decision thresholds
      \item   Variation approaches
    \end{itemize}
  \item   Evaluation Data: Details on the dataset(s) used for the quantitative  analyses in the card.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item   Datasets
      \item   Motivation
      \item   Preprocessing
    \end{itemize}  
  \item   Training Data: May not be possible to provide in practice
    \begin{itemize}
      \item   When possible, this section should mirror Evaluation Data. If such detail is not possible, minimal allowable information should be provided here, such as details of the distribution over various factors in the training  datasets.
    \end{itemize}
  \item   Quantitative Analyses
    \begin{itemize}
      \item   Unitary results
      \item   Intersectional results
    \end{itemize}
  \item   Ethical Considerations
  \item   Caveats and Recommendation
\end{itemize}
