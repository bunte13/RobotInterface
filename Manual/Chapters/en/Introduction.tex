\chapter{Introduction}
This Web application is made for easier functionality execution on the :\textbf{ MicroROS RaspberryPi robot car}.\\
Instead of operating the robot through a virtual machine that connects to the Raspberry Pi OS - (Raspberry Pi Operating system) , we just need to navigate to the function on a web application and after clicking it , it will execute all the commands that are needed to execute the functionality.\\
All the things the user would need to do are: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item connect the robot to a local LAN
	\item connect the local machine to the same LAN
	\item Retrieve the ip address of the robot on the internet provider
	\item Enter the information about the ip address in the web page
	\item Enter (prefabricated) excel sheet in the web page to populate the database.
	\item Execute functions and follow the manual provided by wings-hub
\end{enumerate}
